## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

### What this repo is
GISUGO is a mobile-first job/gig marketplace. It is a **static HTML + CSS + vanilla JavaScript** site (no framework, **no build step, no bundler**) served straight from the repo root, backed by a **Firebase serverless** backend (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Cloud Messaging, Cloud Functions). There are two front-end surfaces sharing the same backend: the consumer app (`index.html`, category pages, `login.html`, `jobs.html`, `profile.html`, `messages.html`, etc.) and the admin dashboard (`admin-dashboard.html`).

### Running the frontend (dev)
There is no build. Serve the repo root as static files and open pages directly:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000    # from repo root; then open http://localhost:8000/index.html
```
- `index.html` and category pages (e.g. `hatod.html` = Transporter, `aircon.html` = AC Cleaner, `plumber.html`, ...) are publicly browsable and load real gig data.
- `jobs.html` is auth-gated and redirects to `login.html`; browse via the category pages when not logged in.

### IMPORTANT: the client talks to LIVE production Firebase
`public/js/firebase-config.js` is hardcoded to the production Firebase project `gisugo1`, and the client has **no emulator wiring** (no `useEmulator` calls). Serving the static files connects reads/writes to the real production backend. Be careful: creating accounts, posting gigs, or writing data hits production. Prefer read-only browsing for smoke tests.

### Cloud Functions (backend)
`functions/` (Node 22). `firebase-tools` is **not** a project dependency. To run the functions emulator, install the CLI to a user-writable prefix (a plain `npm i -g` fails with EACCES because the default prefix is `/usr`):
```bash
npm config set prefix "$HOME/.npm-global"
export PATH="$HOME/.npm-global/bin:$PATH"
npm install -g firebase-tools
cd functions && npm run serve   # = firebase emulators:start --only functions  (starts on :5001, no login needed)
```
The Firestore/PubSub-triggered functions are skipped unless the Firestore/PubSub emulators (which need Java) are also running; the HTTP callable function initializes fine on its own. The `npm ... incompatible with nvm` prefix warning is harmless — `npm install` still succeeds.

### Lint / test / build
There is **no lint config, no test suite, and no build**. As a syntax/build proxy for the backend use:
```bash
node --check functions/index.js
```
