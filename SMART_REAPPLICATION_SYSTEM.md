## Overview

Workers can now apply to a gig **up to 2 times maximum**, with the following rules:

| Application Count | Status | Button State | Can Apply? |
|------------------|--------|--------------|-----------|
| 0 | N/A | "APPLY TO JOB" (Green, Enabled) | ✅ Yes |
| 1 | Pending | "ALREADY APPLIED" (Gray, Disabled) | ❌ No |
| 1 | Accepted (Hired) | "ALREADY APPLIED" (Gray, Disabled) | ❌ No |
| 1 | Rejected | "APPLY AGAIN" (Orange, Enabled) | ✅ Yes (2nd chance!) |
| 2 | Any | "ALREADY APPLIED" (Gray, Disabled) | ❌ No (Max reached) |

## User Experience Flow

### Scenario 1: First Application
```
1. Worker finds a gig
2. Button shows: "APPLY TO JOB" (green)
3. Worker clicks → fills form → submits
4. Application created with status: "pending"
5. Button changes to: "ALREADY APPLIED" (grayed out)
```

### Scenario 2: Rejected - Second Chance
```
1. Customer rejects the application
2. Application status changes to: "rejected"
3. Worker refreshes/revisits gig page
4. Button shows: "APPLY AGAIN" (orange) ♻️
5. Worker can adjust offer/message and reapply
6. New application created with status: "pending"
7. Button changes to: "ALREADY APPLIED" (grayed out)
8. This is the FINAL attempt (no 3rd chance)
```

### Scenario 3: Maximum Reached
```
1. Worker has 2 applications (any statuses)
2. Button shows: "ALREADY APPLIED" (grayed out)
3. Tooltip: "You have reached the maximum number of applications for this job"
4. No more applications possible for this gig
```

## Benefits

### For Workers
✅ **Second chance** - Can adjust offer or improve message after rejection
✅ **Fair opportunity** - One more try if first attempt didn't work
✅ **Clear feedback** - Button text shows exactly what happened

### For Customers
✅ **Spam protection** - Maximum 2 applications per worker
✅ **No harassment** - If rejected twice, worker can't keep trying
✅ **Cleaner inbox** - Not flooded with repeated applications

### For Platform
✅ **Balanced system** - Fair to both sides
✅ **Reduced support** - Less disputes about "unfair blocking"
✅ **Better matches** - Workers can adjust offers based on feedback

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend: `checkIfUserAlreadyApplied()` (dynamic-job.js)

**Query:**
```javascript
db.collection('applications')
  .where('jobId', '==', jobId)
  .where('applicantId', '==', currentUser.uid)
  .orderBy('appliedAt', 'desc')  // Most recent first
  .get()
```

**Logic:**
1. Count total applications
2. Get most recent application status
3. Apply button rules based on count + status

**Button States:**
```javascript
// 0 applications → Keep default "APPLY TO JOB"
if (applicationCount === 0) {
  // Keep button enabled (default state)
}

// 1 rejected application → Show "APPLY AGAIN" (orange)
else if (applicationCount === 1 && mostRecentApp.status === 'rejected') {
  applyBtn.disabled = false;
  applyBtn.style.backgroundColor = '#ff9800';  // Orange
  applyBtn.querySelector('span').textContent = 'APPLY AGAIN';
  applyBtn.title = 'You were rejected. You can apply one more time.';
}

// Anything else → Gray out "ALREADY APPLIED"
else {
  applyBtn.disabled = true;
  applyBtn.style.opacity = '0.5';
  applyBtn.querySelector('span').textContent = 'ALREADY APPLIED';
  // Set appropriate tooltip based on status
}
```

### Backend: `applyForJob()` (firebase-db.js)

**Validation Rules:**

```javascript
// RULE 1: Block if 2+ applications exist (max reached)
if (applicationCount >= 2) {
  return {
    success: false,
    message: 'You have reached the maximum number of applications for this job'
  };
}

// RULE 2: Block if 1 pending or accepted application exists
if (applicationCount === 1) {
  const existingApp = existingApplications.docs[0].data();
  
  if (existingApp.status === 'pending') {
    return { success: false, message: 'You have already applied (pending)' };
  }
  
  if (existingApp.status === 'accepted') {
    return { success: false, message: 'You have already been hired' };
  }
  
  // If status is 'rejected', allow reapplication (fall through)
}

// If we get here, application is allowed
```

---

## Firebase Requirements

### Composite Index Required

The query uses both `where()` and `orderBy()`, which requires a composite index.

**Index Configuration:**
```
Collection: applications
Fields:
  - jobId (Ascending)
  - applicantId (Ascending)
  - appliedAt (Descending)
```

**How to Create:**

**Option 1: Automatic (Recommended)**
- Try to apply to a gig
- Firebase will show error with a link
- Click the link → Index auto-created

**Option 2: Manual**
1. Go to Firebase Console → Firestore → Indexes
2. Click "Create Index"
3. Collection ID: `applications`
4. Add fields:
   - `jobId` → Ascending
   - `applicantId` → Ascending
   - `appliedAt` → Descending
5. Click "Create"

**Wait Time:** ~5-10 minutes for index to build

## Edge Cases Handled

### Case 1: User Applies, Then Gets Rejected, Then Applies Again
```
Application 1: Status = rejected
Application 2: Status = pending
Button State: ALREADY APPLIED (grayed out)
Can Apply Again? NO (2 applications exist)
```

### Case 2: User Applies Twice, Both Get Rejected
```
Application 1: Status = rejected
Application 2: Status = rejected
Button State: ALREADY APPLIED (grayed out)
Can Apply Again? NO (max 2 reached, even if both rejected)
```

### Case 3: User Gets Hired
```
Application 1: Status = accepted
Button State: ALREADY APPLIED (grayed out)
Tooltip: "You have already been hired for this job"
Can Apply Again? NO (already hired)
```

### Case 4: Customer Deletes Application (Admin Action)
```
If application is deleted from Firestore:
→ Application count goes back to 0 or 1
→ Button state recalculates accordingly
→ User may be able to apply again
```

---

## Firestore Data Structure

### Application Document
```javascript
{
  applicationId: "abc123",
  jobId: "job789",
  applicantId: "user456",
  applicantName: "John Doe",
  applicantThumbnail: "https://...",
  status: "pending",  // pending | rejected | accepted
  message: "I'm interested!",
  counterOffer: 500,
  appliedAt: Timestamp,
  rejectedAt: Timestamp,  // Added when rejected
  acceptedAt: Timestamp   // Added when hired
}
```

**Important:** Each new application is a **separate document**. We don't overwrite the old one when reapplying.

## UI Improvements Implemented

### Button Color Coding
- **Green** (default) → "APPLY TO JOB" - First application
- **Orange** (#ff9800) → "APPLY AGAIN" - Second chance after rejection
- **Gray** (50% opacity) → "ALREADY APPLIED" - Blocked/maxed out

### Helpful Tooltips
- Hover over button to see reason why it's disabled
- Different messages for pending, accepted, or max reached

### Clear Feedback
- Button text changes based on state
- Visual indication of application history
- No confusion about "Can I apply again?"

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### 1. Show Application History
Display previous attempts in a collapsible section:
```
📋 Your Previous Applications:
├─ Application 1: Rejected on Jan 15
│  ├─ Offer: ₱500
│  └─ Reason: Not qualified
└─ Application 2: Pending (Jan 20)
   └─ Offer: ₱300
```

### 2. Customer Can Reset Application Count
Add admin button to "Reset & Allow Reapplication"

### 3. Time-Based Cooldown
If rejected, wait 7 days before showing "APPLY AGAIN"

### 4. Analytics
Track reapplication success rates:
- % of rejected workers who reapply
- % of reapplications that get accepted
- Most common price adjustments

## Summary

**What Changed:**
- Maximum 2 applications per worker per gig (was: 1 application max)
- "APPLY AGAIN" button after rejection (was: permanent block)
- Orange button color for reapplication attempts (was: only green/gray)

**What Stayed the Same:**
- Can't apply while pending (was: blocked, still: blocked)
- Can't apply if hired (was: blocked, still: blocked)
- Can't spam applications (was: prevented, still: prevented with max 2 limit)

**Result:** Fair system that gives workers a second chance while protecting customers from spam. 🎯
