# GISUGO Admin Dashboard & Messaging System Redesign

## **PROJECT CONTEXT**
GISUGO is a local job marketplace platform with:
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript static files
- **Current Status**: Fully functional frontend with mock data
- **Admin Dashboard**: Located at admin-dashboard.html with comprehensive responsive design
- **User Interface**: Multiple pages including jobs.html, messages.html, profile.html, etc.

## **CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS**

### **Existing File Structure:**
```
messages.html - Contains: Notifications + Messages + Applications tabs
jobs.html - Contains: Listings + Hiring + Completed tabs  
admin-dashboard.html - Contains: Messages section only
contacts.html - Contact form for user inquiries
```

### **Current Limitations:**
1. **Applications tab** in messages.html feels disconnected from job workflow
2. **Messages tab** mixes user-to-user chat with admin communications
3. **Admin dashboard** lacks broadcast/announcement capabilities
4. **Contact form responses** have no clear admin reply workflow
5. **No unified job application management** system
